# jobseekeR

JobseekeR is one of my side projects.

It is a simple shiny-based job searching platform.

### Supported Platform:    

  + ~~[Indeed](www.indeed.com) (*working in process*)~~    
      * ~~[version 0.1.0](https://jenhichho327.shinyapps.io/jobseekeR/)  **finished**~~
      * [version 0.1.1](https://jenhichho327.shinyapps.io/jobseekeR/)  **add multicore computation -- finished**
  + [Glassdoor](www.glassdoor.com) (*to be cont'd*)
  + [Lagou.com](https://www.lagou.com/) (*to be cont'd*)
  + TBA


### Instructions    

It is easily to use this app:    

  + Step 1: Enter the position you want to search in the upper-left text box
  + Step 2: Choose Indeed.com as the platform you want to use (temporarily it is the only platform that jobseekeR supports)
  + Step 3: Set filters as you want to (**considering to the quality of processors in the backend is not that powerful enough, you'd better do not set too many records, 30 - 60 are the recommended options**)
  + Step 4: Click the `Search` button and then wait for a moment and observe your results freely
